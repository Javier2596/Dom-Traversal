# Dom-Traversal

## Description

This project was designed to show others how DOM (DOcument Object Model) traversal works using methods such as querySelector, setAttribute, and utilizing the local storage with getItem/ setItem, and addEventListener. My motivation for this project was to show the targeted audience that I am capable of creating a functional webpage with a signup button, and able to save data within the browser. This project solves basic DOM traversal issues that a basic website might need. One thing that i learned from this project is that basic code such as single lines of '.queryselector' and '.addEventListener' can make or break a website.

## Installation

There is no installation needed you can simply view this on any browser.

## Usage

When visiting the webpage from your browser you only need to play with the sign up section see what is happening in the DOM. After signing up on the webpage you can check the localstorage located in the browser's developer tools under the 'application' section called 'storage'. From there you will see the data that you enterer being saved. This data is also shared right underneath the sign up section when you finish signing up.
